# CPSC304-JavaDemo
This project is a simulation for a simple car rental campany system using Java/Oracle, the following are the instructions on how to program works:

Step 1: Populating data into database
Under a folder called 'sql scripts', there are three SQL scripts (project_create_tables.sql, project_insert_rows.sql, and project_drop_tables.sql).
Please transfer these three files to the directory you will run SQLPlus from.
Run the commands 'start project_create_tables.sql' followed by 'start project_insert_row.sql' in SQLPlus, this will load the data for the project.

Step 2: Running the project

Run the 'SuperRent' class and provide credentials to login to Oracle, then a command line UI will be available.
